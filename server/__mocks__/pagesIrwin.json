The zoo is run by Director [[Wes Mannion]].\n\nAustralia Zoo was opened by [[Bob Irwin|Bob]] and Lyn Irwin on 3 June 1970 under the name Beerwah Reptile and Fauna Park. Their son [[Steve Irwin|Steve]] had helped his parents since childhood to care for [[crocodile]]s and reptiles and to maintain the growing number of animals in the zoo. In 1982 the park was renamed the Queensland Reptile and Fauna Park and the area was doubled with the purchase of another {{Convert|4|acre}}. Steve and Terri changed the name of their now growing wildlife park to Australia Zoo. As filming generated extra funds, Steve and Terri put all money raised from filming and merchandise into conservation and building new exhibits.\n\nAustralia Zoo won the Australian Tourism Awards for 2003&ndash;2004 in the category Major Tourist Attraction. In 2004, the Australian Animal Hospital was opened next to the zoo to help with animal care and rehabilitation.
