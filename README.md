# The Cannibal Cookbook
Generates recipes that are made with people instead of animal meat, find recipes by searching for the person you want to eat. You can comment on the recipes and some 'characters' willhave their say about them too.

You can't submit recipes because they have to have a certain format for the api to insert the person's name, and you can't submit fully custom recipes because the recipes are stored in JSON and that would be horrible to 'search' through.
